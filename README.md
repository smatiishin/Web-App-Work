# Web-App-Work (HTML, CSS, Front-end JS, Back-end JS, PostgreSQL)
My group and I worked on designing a course registration page with three types of users: students, teachers, and administrators. 
My role was to create the login page and student page, which included frontend(HTML, CSS, Javascript) and backend(Node JS, PostgreSQL).
The project description is defined below:
https://github.com/Really-Average-Developers-R-A-D/Project_Repo

The goal of this project is to create a Web application for managing course registration at a hypothetical higher education institution, a college or university. Previously, the student registration was done in person at the registrar’s office. We want to develop a system which handles the student registration through a Web App.
The proposed system will support three (3) user roles:
1. User role “administrator”: responsible for loading / setting up the system. The admin can create/update/delete users – teachers and students, and college major objects through the UI of the Web App
2. User role “teacher”: responsible for adding, updating, and removing courses from the major curriculum
3. User role “student”: can register for a course or drop a course. This means that a student can add and remove courses from their account
